# Frozen_Horizon
Frozen Horizon is a calm, atmospheric adventure game set in a vast arctic landscape. You play as a lone penguin journeying across endless snowfields toward a distant mountain horizon — a symbol of hope, purpose, and survival.

🐧 Gameplay
Players guide the penguin across the snow, navigating the terrain and progressing toward the horizon. The experience is designed to feel quiet, reflective, and expansive, emphasizing the journey rather than fast-paced mechanics.
